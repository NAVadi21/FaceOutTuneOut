# FaceTune
A project that turns off the music as soon as the user's face is moved away from the screen, Basically it plays the specified music in the project directory as long as the user is standing in front of the camera, When he moves away from the screen - music is paused and it resumes when he comes back in the frame.

Few applications of this project include 

1. Save energy: In public spaces such as shopping malls, museums, or libraries, this project can be used to save energy by turning off the music when no one is around to listen. This can help to reduce the overall energy consumption of the building and save costs.

2. Personal convenience: The project can be used in personal environments such as homes or offices, where users can avoid being disturbed by music when they move away from the scene. For example, if someone is working on an important task and needs to move away from their desk, the music will automatically turn off, minimizing distraction.

3. Safety: In environments where it is important to hear auditory cues such as hospitals or construction sites, the project can help to ensure that music does not interfere with important auditory signals. For example, in a hospital room, the project can turn off music when the nurse or doctor needs to talk to the patient or when important alarms are going off.

4. Social etiquette: In social settings such as restaurants or cafes, the project can help to avoid awkward or disruptive situations where music continues to play when a person leaves their table. This can help to maintain a pleasant atmosphere for all customers.
