# Smart Music Player with Face Detection


This project is a smart music player that automatically pauses the music when the user's face is moved away from the screen and resumes playback when the user comes back into the frame. The goal of this project is to enhance user convenience, save energy, ensure safety, and maintain social etiquette in various environment.

## Features

- Face detection: The project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect the user's face in real-time using a webcam or camera input.

- Music playback: It plays the specified music file located in the project directory as long as the user is in front of the camera.

- Automatic pause and resume: When the user's face moves away from the screen, the music is automatically paused, and when the user comes back into the frame, the music playback is resumed.

## Applications

- **Save energy:** In public spaces such as shopping malls, museums, or libraries, this project can be used to save energy by turning off the music when no one is around to listen. This helps to reduce the overall energy consumption of the building and save costs.

- **Personal convenience:** The project can be used in personal environments such as homes or offices, where users can avoid being disturbed by music when they move away from the screen. For example, if someone is working on an important task and needs to move away from their desk, the music will automatically turn off, minimizing distractions.

- **Safety:** In environments where it is important to hear auditory cues, such as hospitals or construction sites, the project ensures that music does not interfere with important auditory signals. For example, in a hospital room, the project can turn off music when the nurse or doctor needs to communicate with the patient or when important alarms are going off.

- **Social etiquette:** In social settings such as restaurants or cafes, the project helps to avoid awkward or disruptive situations where music continues to play when a person leaves their table. This maintains a pleasant atmosphere for all customers and ensures a better dining experience.
